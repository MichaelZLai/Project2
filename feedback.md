Please review my [inline code comments](https://github.com/MichaelZLai/WODleader/compare/master...nolds9:feedback) prefixed with my initials (`NHO:`)

## Functionality

> Application contains no major errors

Really like how you built an app that solves a personal problem, because now there is a solution for other people!

## Planning / Process / Submission

**1: Progressing**

> App is submitted, with basic evidence of planning. Documentation exists, but lacks common areas such as setup instructions, description of application functionality
